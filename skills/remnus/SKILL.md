# Working with Remnus

Remnus is a Notion-like workspace. You interact with it through the **`remnus` MCP server** — a single connected workspace exposed via bearer-token auth. Every call already runs inside one fixed workspace; you never pass a workspace ID.

The server exposes all three MCP primitives:
- **Tools** — actions you call to read and write (the bulk of your work).
- **Resources** — read-only data you can attach as context, addressed by `remnus://…` URIs.
- **Prompts** — server-side templates that fetch + format data for common tasks (summaries, reports, triage).

Use the right one: resources to *pull context cheaply*, tools to *act*, prompts to *kick off a structured task*.

## The data model (read this first)

Two kinds of things live in the workspace, side by side in one sidebar tree:

- **Pages** — a title + markdown `content`. Can be nested under a parent (`parentId`).
- **Databases** — a typed `schema` (columns) plus rows. **Each row is itself a page**: it has a `title`, markdown `content`, an icon, AND a `properties` object keyed by column.

So "a page" can mean a standalone page *or* a database row. Most read tools auto-detect which, so you rarely need to care — but when you create or update, the distinction matters (see below).

Column types: `text` | `number` | `select` | `multi_select` | `date` | `datetime`.
`multi_select` values are **arrays**; everything else is scalar.

## Tools at a glance

**Read (safe, always allowed):**
- `search` — find pages/databases by title. Your usual entry point.
- `list_workspace` — list items, optionally under a `parentId`. Paginated.
- `get_page` — full content of a page or row by ID. Auto-detects type.
- `get_database_schema` — columns only, no rows. Cheap; call before querying.
- `query_database` — schema + rows, with optional `filters`. Paginated.
- `list_members` — workspace members and roles.
- `query_audit_log` — history of MCP tool calls (yours and other agents').

**Write (needs a write-scoped token):**
- `create_page` — new standalone page OR database row (see decision below).
- `update_page` — change title/content/properties of one item.
- `bulk_update` — many updates in one call. Prefer this over a loop.
- `delete_page` — delete a page, row, or whole database. **Guarded.**
- `move_item` — reparent a sidebar item; `newParentId: null` → root.
- `create_database` — new database with a custom schema.
- `update_database_schema` — add/remove columns. Removing is **guarded.**

If a write tool returns "This token only has read scope," the user connected a read-only token — tell them; do not retry.

## Resources — `remnus://…`

Resources are read-only and listable; many clients let you attach them directly as context, which is cheaper and cleaner than a tool round-trip when you just need to *read*:

- `remnus://workspace/{id}/schema` — every database in the workspace plus its columns, in one document. Best first pull to understand what databases exist and their shapes.
- `remnus://database/{id}/schema` — columns of one database (same data as `get_database_schema`).
- `remnus://page/{id}` — a page or row rendered as markdown (title + properties + content). Listing returns the 20 most recently updated; any page is reachable by its ID.
- `remnus://audit-log/recent` — the last 50 activity entries for *this* token.

Rule of thumb: if the user just wants you to **read/understand**, prefer attaching the resource. If you need to **filter, paginate, or act**, use the equivalent tool (`query_database`, `get_page`, etc.). The schema resources and the `get_database_schema` tool return the same thing — either is fine.

## Prompts — structured task starters

The server ships five prompt templates that pre-fetch the relevant Remnus data and hand you a ready-to-run instruction. When the client surfaces prompts, **prefer them** over assembling the same context by hand:

- `summarize-page` — `page_id`, optional `style` (`bullet` | `paragraph` | `tldr`).
- `weekly-status-report` — `database_id`, optional `period` (e.g. "last week"). Groups by status, flags blockers/wins.
- `kanban-triage` — `database_id`. What needs attention, what's blocked, what to deprioritize, next 3 actions.
- `extract-tasks` — `page_id`. Pulls actionable items into a markdown checklist (action / owner / deadline / priority).
- `search-and-create` — `title` + `query`. Finds similar existing pages so a new one complements rather than duplicates.

These only *fetch and format* — the actual writing/analysis is yours. If a client doesn't expose prompts, reproduce them: query the data with the read tools, then do the summary/triage yourself.

## Core rules — do not skip these

### 1. Inspect before you act
Don't guess IDs or column names. Start from `search` or `list_workspace`, and run `get_database_schema` before `query_database` / before writing rows. You need real column IDs and the exact `select` option strings — invented values silently produce empty filters or unset properties.

### 2. `update_page` MERGES properties — it never replaces
Passing `properties: { status: "Done" }` changes only `status`; every other property is untouched. To *clear* a field, set it explicitly to `null`/`""`. Never re-send the whole property bag thinking you must preserve it — you don't, and doing so risks clobbering changes made since you read.

### 3. Confirm destructive operations with the human, not just the flag
`delete_page` and `update_database_schema` (when removing columns) require `confirm: true`. That flag is a safety latch, not your decision to make:
- Call them **once without `confirm`** to get the preview ("This will permanently delete …").
- Show that preview to the user and get an explicit yes.
- Only then call again with `confirm: true`.
Deleting a database row is irreversible; deleting a database or a parent page cascades to its children. Removing a column destroys that column's data across all rows.

### 4. Filtering & pagination
- `query_database` filters use column ID → value: `{ "col_status": "Done" }`. For `multi_select`, pass an array: `{ "col_tags": ["Bug"] }`. Get exact IDs/options from `get_database_schema`.
- When a response has `hasMore: true`, pass its `nextCursor` back as `cursor` to get the next page. Keep going until `hasMore` is false if the user asked for "all". Don't crank `limit` to a huge number to dodge pagination.

### 5. create_page: page vs row
- **Standalone page** → pass `title`, `content`, optional `parentId`.
- **Database row** → pass `databaseId` (+ `title`, `content`, `properties`). The row is created inside that database.
Don't pass both `parentId` and `databaseId`. Property keys must match the database's column IDs.

### 6. Batch, don't loop
Updating several rows (e.g. "mark all done")? Build one `bulk_update` call. It's one audit entry and one round-trip instead of N.

### 7. Content is markdown
`content` is plain markdown. Headings, lists, tables, checkboxes (`- [ ]`) all work. Write clean markdown, not HTML.

## Common recipes

**"Find X and show me"** → `search` → `get_page` on the best hit.

**"What's in my Tasks database?"** → `search` (or `list_workspace`) to get the DB id → `get_database_schema` → `query_database` (filter/paginate as needed).

**"Mark these tasks done" / bulk edits** → `get_database_schema` for the status column id and the "Done" option string → `query_database` to resolve row IDs → one `bulk_update`.

**"Add a new task"** → resolve the database id → `get_database_schema` for property keys → `create_page` with `databaseId` + `properties`.

**"Set up a database for X"** → `create_database` with a sensible schema (a Title column is auto-prepended). Then `create_page` rows.

**Reports / triage / summaries** → use the matching **prompt** (see the Prompts section). Fall back to read-tools + your own summary if prompts aren't exposed.

## When unsure
Ask the user which workspace item or database they mean rather than acting on a fuzzy match — titles repeat. Surface the audit log (`query_audit_log`) if they ask "what did the agent change?"
