# Remnus MCP

Remnus MCP is a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server built into every Remnus workspace. It lets AI agents — Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, and any MCP-compatible client — read and write your workspace data over a standard HTTP API.

## What you can do

- Query pages and databases with full-text search and property filters
- Create and update pages, database rows, and entire databases
- Automate reports, task extraction, and kanban triage with built-in prompts
- Monitor all agent activity through a structured audit log

## Endpoint

```
https://www.remnus.com/api/mcp
```

Always use the `www` host — the apex `remnus.com` redirects to `www.remnus.com`, and some OAuth clients reject the resulting resource-indicator mismatch. Supports both **Streamable HTTP** (stateless, one request per call) and **SSE** (stateful, persistent connection).

## Quick start

1. Open your workspace → sidebar **AI Agents** button → **Connect editor**
2. Pick your editor. Most connect with **OAuth** — no token to copy, just approve the consent screen in your browser on first connect. Prefer a token? Expand **Advanced** to mint one.
3. Ask your agent to list your workspace — see [Getting Started](getting-started.md) for the full walkthrough
